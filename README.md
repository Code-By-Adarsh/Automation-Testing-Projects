# üöÄ Automation Testing Projects  

This repository contains all my **Automation Testing Projects** that I have built while learning **Selenium WebDriver** and **TestNG Framework**.  
It includes a collection of **basic, intermediate, and advanced** level projects to demonstrate my understanding of automation testing concepts, best practices, and real-world test scenarios.

## üß† About This Repository  

This repository is a showcase of my hands-on learning journey in the field of automation testing.  
Each project is created with the goal of improving my testing skills and understanding of different automation techniques using **Java + Selenium + TestNG**.

As I continue learning, I will keep adding more projects in this repository covering:
- Advanced TestNG features  
- Page Object Model (POM) implementation  
- Data-Driven Testing  
- Parallel Execution  
- Reporting tools (Extent Reports, Allure Reports, etc.)

## üßæ Learning Goals

Through these projects, I aim to:

1.Strengthen my understanding of Selenium WebDriver and TestNG

2.Write clean, reusable, and maintainable automation scripts

3.Learn best practices in automation framework design

4.Gain confidence for real-world testing projects and internship opportunities
